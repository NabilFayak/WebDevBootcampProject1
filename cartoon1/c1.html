                <td>Avatar is hands down the best cartoon I've ever watched. I would even go to the extent of arguing with others people about how great the show is. From the plot, to the underlyings themes, to the action, it's everything a kid could ask for. Once I grew up and rewatched it, I could only appreciate it more as I was able to pick up on all of the more serious undertones of the show from slavery, to war, to internal strife, this show is a masterpiece.
